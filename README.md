# Hello Github Family :), This is my basic game using Python. I am open to any suggestions
# When the enemies (red squares) moving across the screen, player controls a blue square.
# Player can escape from the enemies by moving horizontally using left or right arrow buttons on the keyboard and player can jump using space button. Hitting the enemies finishes the game.
